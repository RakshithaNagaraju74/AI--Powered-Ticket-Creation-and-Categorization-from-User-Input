# Nexus AI – Intelligent Enterprise Support Suite

<div align="center">

**An enterprise-grade, BERT-powered ticketing and support intelligence ecosystem**

</div>

## 📋 Overview

Nexus AI is a high-performance support management system designed to automate the lifecycle of IT support tickets. By utilizing **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**, the system performs deep semantic analysis on unstructured user messages to automatically classify categories, predict priority levels, and extract critical technical entities.

---

## 🔁 End-to-End Pipeline

The system transforms raw user input into high-fidelity structured data through a sophisticated neural pipeline:

```text
       User Message Ingress (React UI)
                    ↓
  Text Cleaning & Normalization (Regex, SpaCy, Lemmatization)
                    ↓
  Language Detection & Translation (Google Translator API)
                    ↓
  BERT Semantic Feature Extraction (Transformer Tokenization)
                    ↓
  Neural Inference (Multi-Head Category & Priority Prediction)
                    ↓
     Entity Extraction (NER - Devices, Errors, Usernames)
                    ↓
   Structured Ticket Generation (JSON persistence in MongoDB)

```

## 🧪 Current Project Status

* **Real-time HUD**: Live dashboards tracking **Active Agents** (via Socket.io Map), response times, and resolution rates.
* **Neural Classification**: BERT-based models trained to handle complex IT semantics with high confidence scoring.
* **Hybrid Role Tracking**: Real-time handshake logic implemented to distinguish between support agents and users.
* **Automated Triage**: Sub-400ms latency for automated routing based on predicted priority and category.

## 🧾 Example Ticket Schema (JSON)

The following represents a typical structured output generated by the AI Engine and stored in MongoDB:

```json
{
  "title": "Incident Report",
  "description": "Critical data loss reported in cloud environment",
  "userEmail": "user@example.com",
  "category": "account/access issue",
  "priority": "critical",
  "status": "resolved",
  "category_confidence": 0.525,
  "priority_confidence": 0.904,
  "entities": {
    "devices": [],
    "usernames": ["@admin"],
    "error_codes": ["0xERR404"]
  },
  "slaBreached": false,
  "escalationLevel": 0,
  "created_at": "2026-01-18T15:50:56.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-01-18T19:22:42.502Z"
}

```
